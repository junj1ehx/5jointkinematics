# 5jointkinematics
This python project, referred to as \textbf{5JointArmDrawer} is designed for the topic of report assignment: implementing Kinematics for something with three or more joints. Generally, \textbf{5JointArmDrawer} implemented visualization of a drawing process of user-customized shape with an arm-length-customizable 5-joints-arm robots. This program was written in python 3, used NumPy and Matplotlib libraries. The source code is available on the Github\footnote{} The key features of this program are given as follows:


- Drawing Shape is customizable
- Animation of the movement of joints and points
- Customizable length of joints
- Output of many useful information within kinematics calculation process (The Pseudo Inverse Method), which enables further postprocessing
- Easy to use
