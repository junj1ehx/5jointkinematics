# 5jointkinematics
This python project, referred to as 5JointArmDrawer is designed for the topic of report assignment: implementing Kinematics for something with three or more joints. Generally, 5JointArmDrawer implemented visualization of a drawing process of user-customized shape with an arm-length-customizable 5-joints-arm robots. This program was written in python 3, used NumPy and Matplotlib libraries. The source code is available on the Github The key features of this program are given as follows:


- Drawing Shape is customizable
- Animation of the movement of joints and points
- Customizable length of joints
- Output of many useful information within kinematics calculation process (The Pseudo Inverse Method), which enables further postprocessing
- Easy to use

# requirements
- python 3.x
- NumPy
- matplotlib
